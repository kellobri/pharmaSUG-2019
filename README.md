# PharmaSUG 2019

## From Static ggplot2 to Interactive Plotly to Shiny App

I had a great time live coding through some ggplot2, plotly, R Markdown and Shiny examples in my talk at `#pharmasug2019` in Philadelphia. Be sure to connect with my colleagues [Lauren Chadwick](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurenchadwick6/) and [Jason Milnes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonmilnes/) if you want to learn more about R and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/).

**The slides for this talk are available on [SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/kellobri/from-static-ggplot2-to-interactive-plotly-to-shiny-app).**

The code for this demonstration has been adapted from materials developed by [Sean Lopp](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-lopp-86301368/) and [Phil Bowsher](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philip-bowsher-67151015/). You may have also seen Phil speak at PharmaSUG - Phil is the Director of Life Sciences & Healthcare at RStudio. His presentation materials are available [here](https://github.com/philbowsher/PharmaSUG-2019-Creating-Sharing-Shiny-Apps-Gadgets).
